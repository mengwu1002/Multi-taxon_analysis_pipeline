# Multi-taxon_analysis_pipeline
This package was developed to process the raw sequencing data from multitaxon-INSeq experiments generated on an Illumina sequencer in fastq format, map the transposon insertion locations, count the numbers of reads associated with respective locations, and generate output files of the analyzed data.
